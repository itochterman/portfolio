inheritance 

they're all in a line then they are none
red-eyed and chomping at the bit
some are widowed and others never found love 
now they're tired as the sun bleeds once more 
and they patch and scratch at their eyes 
with any object 

like a daughter
who wishes for the last time 
and shares until shes gone 
and tried with the stains of womanhood
down her belly
large from one last prayer
tied to mother by the hope to be whole
