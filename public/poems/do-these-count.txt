do these count as thoughts?


It�s like tossing a moment in the blender
chunks of sneaky ice left to burn in the mouth. 

I hate wrinkles. 
I hate raspberries with moldy centers.
I hate spending $5.00 on mold
      and getting fat anyway. 
I hate the trauma I�ve caused this bed. 

Sometimes there is a glow that touches people
and the scene makes sense 
	
	I promise some day I�ll lose you
	body I promise 
      to hate 
      less
      body
      a whole body
      is so much space 
      
      
once we never graduate
the moment 
in bed with the ugly things 
not really in service 

This is the brain I hate
does it make sense?
when to finish 
when to wake up 
never better
